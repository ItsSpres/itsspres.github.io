# About Me

## A Passion for Cybersecurity

I’m passionate about using my background in **Computer Information Systems (CIS)** and **Business Analysis and Management** to help organizations navigate the complex world of cybersecurity. With a deep understanding of business processes and IT infrastructure, I aim to bridge the gap between security and business strategy.

### Education:
- **Bachelor of Science** in Computer Information Systems (CIS)  
- **Minor in Business Analysis and Management**

### Career Shift to Cybersecurity
My interest in **cybersecurity** grew as I saw the increasing number of cyberattacks and data breaches affecting organizations. This motivated me to pursue certifications and hands-on experience in penetration testing, network security, and risk management.

I’m currently working on:

- **Learning Ethical Hacking** with hands-on labs.
- **Studying for CompTIA Security+ Certification**.
- **Exploring Network Security** and threat mitigation strategies.

I’m excited to connect with professionals in the cybersecurity community and contribute to making the internet a safer place!
