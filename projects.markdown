# My Cybersecurity Projects

## 1. **Network Penetration Testing Lab**

In this project, I set up a virtual network environment to practice penetration testing. I used tools like **Kali Linux**, **Metasploit**, and **Wireshark** to test and secure a variety of vulnerable virtual machines.

## 2. **Website Security Assessment**

A comprehensive assessment of a local website for vulnerabilities. I used tools like **OWASP ZAP** and **Burp Suite** to scan for common security flaws such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure server configurations.
